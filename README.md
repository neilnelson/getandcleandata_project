### Requirement

You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. See https://class.coursera.org/getdata-007/human_grading/view/courses/972585/assessments/3/submissions.

### Scripts

**run_analysis.R** - This is the only script. See the script for detailed processing descriptions.

 * The **data.table** and **tidyr** packages are required.

 * A **tidy_data_set.txt** file is written to the work directory containing the required project script result.
